hD Thesis Repository named: "Engineering Forensic-Ready Software Systems with Automated Logging"

This repository contains the resources used in my PhD thesis to evaluate my Forensic-Ready Logger (FRL) tool by conducting two computational in the Human Resources Management Software System (HRM) and the Open Hospital Software System (OH).

It includes the following folders:

1.- Evaluation: Contains the files with the results of the two computational studies in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes two folders:
```
1.1 Attack Scenarios: Each computational study, contains 12 folders, which include the input and output files
                      from the incident modelling and logging generation stages.
1.2 Documents:        Contains the description and the results of each attack scenario. It also includes a description
                      of the main functionalities that can be performed in each software system.
```

2.- Software: Contains the files with the source code used in the two computational studies in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes three folders:
```
2.1 Databases: Contains the files to create the databases for the HRM and the FRL software systems. 
2.2 Systems:   Contains the files with the JAVA source code for the HRM, the FRL and
               the ObtainRandomActivities software systems. 
2.2 Manuals:   Contains the documents with the instructions to install in your computer the HRM,
               FRL and the ObtainRandomActivities software systems.
```
