#PhD Thesis Repository named: "Engineering Forensic-Ready Software Systems with Automated Logging"

This repository contains the resources used in my PhD thesis to evaluate my Forensic-Ready Logger (FRL) tool by 
conducting two computational in the Human Resources Management Software System (HRM) and the Open Hospital Software System (OH).

It includes the Evaluation and the Software folders.

1.- Evaluation: Contains the files with the results of the two computational studies 
                in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes two folders:
```
1.1 Attack Scenarios: It includes two folders that contain each computational study for each software system:
                      HRM and OH.
                      Each computational study contains 12 folders. Each folder includes the input and output files
                      from the incident modelling and logging generation stages.

1.2 Documents:        Contains the description and the results of each attack scenario.
                      It also includes a description of the main functionalities of each software system.

2.- Software: Contains the files with the source code used in the two computational studies 
              in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes four folders:
```
2.1 Databases: Contains the files to create the databases for the HRM and the FRL software systems.

2.2 Systems:   Contains the files with the JAVA source code for the HRM, the FRL and
               the ObtainRandomActivities software systems.

2.3 Manuals:   Contains the documents with the instructions to install on your computer the HRM,
               FRL and the ObtainRandomActivities software systems.

2.4 Libraries: Contains the Java libraries that the FRL software system calls internally.
