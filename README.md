#PhD Thesis Repository named: "Engineering Forensic-Ready Software Systems with Automated Logging"

Hello. WELCOME to my PhD_Thesis repository! 

This repository contains the resources used in my PhD thesis to evaluate my Forensic-Ready Logger (FRL) tool where I 
conducted two computational in the Human Resources Management Software System (HRM) and the Open Hospital Software System (OH).
It also contains the resources of the ObtainRandomActivities (ORA) software system used during the computational studies.

The PhD_Thesis GitHub repository includes the Evaluation and the Software folders.

1.- Evaluation: Contains the files with the results of the two computational studies in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes two folders:
```
1.1 Attack Scenarios: It includes two folders that contain the resources used in each computational study for each software system:
                      HRM and OH.
                      Each computational study contains 12 folders.
                      Each folder includes the input and output files that are used
                      during the execution of the incident modelling, and logging generation stages.

1.2 Documents:        a) Contains the description of the steps of each attack scenario.
                         This information can be found in the Attack_Scenarios_HRM.xlsx and Attack_Scenarios_OH.xlsx files in the
                         in the Attack Scenario tab.
                      b) Includes the experimental conditions used in the two computational studies and during the executing
                         of all the attack scenarios in the incident modelling and logging generation stages.
                         This information can be found in the Attack_Scenarios_HRM.xlsx and Attack_Scenarios_OH.xlsx files
                         in the Experimental_Conditions tabs.
                      c) Includes the results of the attack scenario in the incident modelling and logging generation stages.
                         This information can be found in the Attack_Scenarios_HRM.xlsx and Attack_Scenarios_OH.xlsx files
                         in the Incident Modelling and Logging Generation tabs.
                      d) Includes a description of the main functionalities of each software system.
                         This information can be found in the Main_Funcionalites_HRM.xlsx and Main_Funcionalities_OH.xlsx files
                         in the Activities tab.
```

2.- Software: Contains the files with the source code used in the two computational studies in the HRM and OH software systems.

It includes four folders:
```
2.1 Databases: Contains the files to create the databases for the HRM and the FRL software systems.

2.2 Systems:   Contains the files with the Java source code for the HRM, the FRL and
               the ObtainRandomActivities software systems.

2.3 Manuals:   Contains the documents with the instructions to install on your computer the HRM,
               FRL and the ORA software systems.

2.4 Libraries: Contains the Java libraries that the FRL software system calls internally.
