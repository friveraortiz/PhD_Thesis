1.- The controller.UserController.validateUser method is included in the security log 3 times. 
These times corresponds when during the attack scenario an external attacker misused the credentials of a System Administrator and tried to connect to the HRM software System.
This is the moment when a brute force security incident happened and we recorded the evidence.
